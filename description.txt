The Collection [WIP] at this moment has:

- 17 new items
- 3 new buffs
- 3 new town NPC

The mod currently adds a small update to the meteorite, creating a hardmode version of it (don't need new world), adding an NPC:
	- The Meteorman: who will help you with the new ore.
There are also 2 extra NPCs:
	- The Ninja: sells ninja related items and will give you ninja buffs.	
	- The Archaeologist: sells useful items at the beginning of the game.

Notes:
Multiplayer compatibility is unknown, due to the lack of testing. 

More notes:

The initial objective of the mod is focused on the paintings, it is planned to add an NPC specialized in it, similar to the Angler in a way. But I am quite a newbie to modding and spriting.
So in principle i will try to add more content in little explored and more basic aspects of the game, such as marble caves, granite, beehive... while I learn more.
I know there are more mods that do this, but you have to start with something.

Suggestions, recommendations and stuff will be appreciated
